<h1><span class="mw-headline">So what can you do, right now?</span></h1>

<p>
  <b>Spread the word.</b> <a href="/Supporters" title="Supporters">Become a supporter</a> 
  of the webUML initiative. Put a badge on your site, blog, ...
  Talk to your friends and colleagues about this <a href="/Call_for_Action"
  title="Call for Action">Call for Action</a> and invite them to also subscribe
  and support it. The first thing we have to do is create awareness. We need to
  show the people who define and create the tools we use on a daily basis, that
  the time has come to leverage the collaborative power of the internet. (<a
  href="/References" title="References">See</a> what others are saying about the
  webUML initiative)
</p>

<p>
  <b>Discuss these ideas.</b> Write about these ideas
  on your blogs, discuss with your readers about the possible merits and
  pitfalls. Once we've created awareness we need to come up with solid
  solutions. We don't want a second decade of darkness. We want to get it right
  this time. We will set up an online forum very soon and invite everybody to
  join in the discussion. So check back for that.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Act now.</b> If you
  are a developer of a UML-enabled tool and want to prepare your tool for the
  new age, now is the time. Or, if you happen to know people working on such a
  tool, point them in this direction. We want to become a hub between all these
  people, allowing them to jointly define the new way of dealing with UML
  online.
