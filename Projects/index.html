title: webUML - releasing UML on the web
---

<h1><span class="mw-headline">Projects</span></h1>
<p>
  Below are projects that responded to the <a href="/Call_for_Action"
  title="Call for Action">Call for Action</a> and try to release UML onto the
  web. They can help you in bringing your own UML models to the web today, but
  can also serve as as source of inspiration on how you can help to realise
  vision of the webUML initiative.
</p>

<p>
  We divide them into several categories which are basically the corners of
  our <a href="/Triangle" title="Triangle">Triangle</a> that we believe are
  required to successfully bring UML to the web, extended with a presentation
  category.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Presentation</span></h2>

<p>
  These tools allow diagrams to be visualized online. Presentation is not part
  of the <a href="/Triangle" title="Triangle">Triangle</a> because the
  technology to realize this is already common enough and won't be a blocking
  issue. These tools can be seen as very simple CASE tools, but fully
  web-enabled.
