  It's two in the afternoon and you're working on a UML diagram for your latest
  project. Suddenly you feel something isn't quite right and you want a second
  opinion. Let's send it to a friend for review. Four eyes is always better than
  two. So, you select all elements on the diagram in your CASE tool, press the
  magic copy &amp; paste keystrokes and a picture of your diagram is shining
  brightly in your email client. Add some text, et voila, in mere seconds your
  friend can see your diagram in his own mail client. Everybody is happy ...
  Right? 
</p>

<p>
  Your friend wants to help you out, but all he has is this email with
  a picture in it. So he has little to no other option than to draw the diagram
  himself, in his own CASE tool, adapt it and again copy &amp; paste it into a
  reply to you. And then you also again have to manually apply all modifications
  your friend made to your diagram.
</p>

<p>
  But wait, this is foolish. We have XMI, a standard way of exchanging UML in
  XML format. Let's just export our model, send it attached to an email to our
  friend, have him import it in his tool, ... only to see that it is no longer
  formatted, it doesn't even contain any diagrams anymore, because XMI simply
  doesn't do diagrams.
