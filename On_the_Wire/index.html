<h2><span class="mw-headline">Architecture Ecosystem SIG</span></h2>

<p>
  The Architecture Ecosystem SIG (AE SIG) is a new activity of the Object
  Management Group (OMG), to provide for improved definition and integration of
  models and modeling languages within an ecosystem where modeling tools and
  languages can be used together more effectively. Modeling in this context
  includes all forms of structured knowledge representation, including: Business
  Models, Vocabularies, Ontologies, Object Models, System Models, SOA Models,
  Data Models, Schema, Process Models, Domain Specific Languages, etc.
</p>

<p>
  The mission of the Architecture Ecosystem SIG (AE SIG) is to work with OMG
  domain and platform task forces, other relevant OMG SIGs, external entities
  and related industry groups to facilitate the creation of a common
  architectural ecosystem. This ecosystem will support the creation, analysis,
  integration and exchange of information between modeling languages across
  different domains, viewpoints and from differing authorities. In particular
  the need for business and enterprise level architectural viewpoints must be
  better integrated with the technical viewpoints that define systems to address
  enterprise needs. The AE SIG will focus on the capability to define and
  integrate languages and models in various viewpoints and support other groups
  that will focus on the specific viewpoints required for their specific
  domains. The set of viewpoints, supporting models and supporting technologies
  will comprise the ecosystem.<br>
