  The webUML initiative aims to make UML modelling a social
  experience. We believe that three important components play a role in
  successfully bringing UML to the web: 
</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Common Knowledge</span></h2>
<p>
  Without knowledge very little can be achieved. And,
  don't get me wrong, there is a lot of knowledge regarding UML on this little
  blue planet. But when it's hard to communicate using UML, it will be even
  harder to communicate about UML. And because of all this, today we see that
  almost every company has its own in-house "implementation" of UML, defining
  how to write down their analysis using this Unified Modelling Language.
</p>

<p>
  As with many things, it's probably a naming issue. Language is hardly
  the correct term here. Syntax would have been a far better choice. A language
  is much more than just syntax. It consists of a grammar and idioms. UML is
  beyond any doubt a great syntax, but we're not speaking the same language yet.

</p>

<p>
  Sure, there are design patterns and integration patterns and ... But
  that's pretty much where it ends. All these patterns are rather technical in
  nature and don't really address functional, nor business issues. We need to be
  able to share a common knowledge of a much higher level of patterns, start
  sharing these functional and business models, reuse them and stop designing
  the same concepts over and over again, recreating the same bugs over and over
  again.
</p>

<p>
  It is time to extract the common knowledge from all the isolated
  models in the world and bring it together in an open and accessible Central
  Repository.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Central Repository</span></h2>
<p>
  If we want to make our Common Knowledge available to almost anyone with a
  web-enabled device, we need some form of a central repository. Let's define
  what a valid solution to this requirement should look like before it qualifies
  as a central repository:
</p>

<p>
  Any digital resource on a public server,
  containing a model or a diagram is a valid central repository, as long as the
  model or diagram can be visually consulted and retrieved in an automated way
  from that resource.
</p>

<p>
  A picture of a diagram may tell a thousand words,
  but in this case, we want both of them: a picture to see what model or diagram
  we're dealing with before we import the actual content into our local tool and
  continue to work on it. So, uploading an XMI export of our diagram along with
  a screenshot to a web server doesn't fit the requirements, because we cannot
  import the XMI document and have an exact copy of the diagram in the
  screenshot. We will need new tools to realise this.
</p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Integration</span></h2>
<p>
  Finally, we also have to deal with history. UML has a history and CASE
  tools have a history. We can't simply ignore that and we have to drag along
  this legacy. So integrating all the new and fun stuff with the old is a task
  we need to address. We need to web-enable as many CASE tools as possible.
</p>

<p>
  This is a daunting task, but it is an important one. We don't want to -
  and simply can not ask everybody to - stop using their current tools and
  migrate to some new platform. That is not the goal of this initiative. We want
  models to stay where they are, but enable them to roam the web.
</p>

<p>
  To achieve this, existing CASE tools will need to be extended to allow them to
  connect to a Central Repository and access the Common Knowledge.
